# Google CSR 2024 Work
Here is all the work done in Google CSR 2024.

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Deep Q-Learning for Adaptive Speed Control in Autonomous Vehicles
Google CSR Research Project | [January 2024 - June 2024]

* Developed and implemented a Deep Q-Neural Network (DQN) model to optimize speed management in autonomous vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Utilized Highway-env simulator to create high-density vehicular scenarios for training and testing the DQN model
* Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning, optimizing learning rate, batch size, buffer size, and exploration fraction to enhance model performance
* Analyzed the impact of varying traffic densities, vehicle speeds, and number of controlled vehicles on the model's effectiveness
* Implemented experience replay technique to improve training stability and efficiency
* Achieved significant improvements in episode lengths, rewards, and overall training stability
* Collaborated with a diverse team of researchers from multiple institutions, contributing to a multidisciplinary approach
* Presented findings in a research poster at the Google CSR event, demonstrating clear communication of complex technical concepts
* Results showed potential for real-world application in enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles

Key Skills Demonstrated:
Deep Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, Hyperparameter Tuning, Simulation Environments, Data Analysis, Collaborative Research, Technical Communication
